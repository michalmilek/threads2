# Clone Threads

Clone Threads is an application for sharing posts, communicating with other users through comments, and giving likes to other posts. This project is built with Nuxt 3, Supabase, and Tailwind CSS.

## What I've Done

1. **Authentication:**
   - Implemented user registration and login mechanism using Supabase services.
   - Created registration and login forms and performed validation on user input.

2. **Adding Posts:**
   - Enabled users to add new posts to the service.
   - Created a form for adding posts and handled sending data to the Supabase database.

## Planned Functionalities

1. **Likes:**
   - I will design a feature for liking posts, allowing users to express their interest in specific posts.
   - Additionally, I will implement a likes counter that updates when a new like is added.

2. **Comments:**
   - I will enable users to add comments to existing posts.
   - I will create a comment form and display a list of comments for each post.

3. **Deleting Records:**
   - I plan to implement functionalities for deleting posts and comments.
   - I will add "Delete" buttons that appear next to each post or comment, allowing users to delete the corresponding record.

## Used Technologies
